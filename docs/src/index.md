# Overview

DeepViz is an open source, extensive package for Model intrepretability built on Flux, a Julia based package for Machine Leanrning and Deep Learning. 

With an increase the model complexity, it is important at times to interpret what your model is learning over the period of training, which at times becomes an important aspect to analyze the performance of model. Model Interpretability has been an active area of reasearch, to understand what a model actually learns using different algorithms and techniques like GradCAM, SmoothGrad etc. DeepViz provides various algorithms to allows developers and researchs develop a better understanding of their models and respective outputs.

DeepViz helps users easily implement various Interpretability algorithms for the Models build on Flux. Moreover, this package may also prove helpful for developers to troubleshoot by facilitating the identification of different features that contribute to a modelâ€™s output.

# Target Audience

DeepViz is primarily meant for Flux based Model developers who are looking to imporve their models and / or to undertand what their model is learning. This package may also be helpful for researchers, who are interested in identification of different features that contribute to model's output, how varying them changes the results.

# Contributions

This package an extensive support with respect to various interpretability algorithms. However, still there are many `state-of-the-art` algorithms for model interpretation which are yet to be implemented in this package. If you would like add some, feel free to create a PR, or you may also create an issue in the repository to request any feature that you think might be useful. Any other kind of contribution are always welcome.
